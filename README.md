# Shocks-and-coping-in-Mali

We test whether different shocks affect differently households coping strategies. Here we assume that the intensity of each shock varies across locations and that households do not experience the same category of shock multiple times:


where a household’s choice for adopting coping strategy $j$ is $C_j$, $(j=1,…,J)$, $co_n$ is conflict  shock $n$ $( i= 0,1,…I)$, control variables are vector $X$ and $G$ is the cumulative density function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.
