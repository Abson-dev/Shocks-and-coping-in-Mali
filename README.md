# Shocks-and-coping-in-Mali

We test whether different shocks affect differently households coping strategies. Here we assume that the intensity of each shock varies across locations and that households do not experience the same category of shock multiple times:

- (1)

where a household’s choice for adopting coping strategy $j$ is $C_j$, $(j=1,…,J)$, $co_n$ is conflict  shock $n$ $( i= 0,1,…I)$, control variables are vector $X$ and $G$ is the cumulative density function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. 

- (2)


where a household’s choice for adopting coping strategy $j$ is $C_j$, $(j=1,…,J)$, $p_n$ is price  shock $n$ $( i= 0,1,…I)$, control variables are vector $X$ and $G$ is the cumulative density function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. 
- (3)


where a household’s choice for adopting coping strategy $j$ is $C_j$, $(j=1,…,J)$, $T_n$ is seasonal performance  shock $n$ $( i= 0,1,…I)$, control variables are vector $X$ and $G$ is the cumulative density function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. 
- (4)


where a household’s choice for adopting coping strategy $j$ is $C_j$, $(j=1,…,J)$, $W_n$ is climate  shock  shock $n$ $( i= 0,1,…I)$, control variables are vector $X$ and $G$ is the cumulative density function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.

*Effect of shocks and coping strategy choices on food security*

In this setup, endogeneity may arise from two sources. Given that households may self-select and choose particular coping strategies and not others, food security and coping strategy choices may be interdependent. Furthermore, unobserved factors influencing coping strategy choices may also influence food security. For instance, food-secure households might adopt more ex ante risk management strategies that make them more capable of coping with shocks than food-insecure households. Although food security may also influence coping strategy choices, we do not expect this to happen since households reported shocks that occurred in the past whereas the food security data is more recent.
Endogeneity may arise from unobserved factors that may influence the choice of one coping strategy as opposed to the others. To account for possible endogeneity, food security model is probit model expressed as follow:

where $C_j$ is expected probably from equation (5) $K$ is the number of possible outcomes; "outcome"  denotes a food security indicators.
